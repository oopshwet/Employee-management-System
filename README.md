Abstract of the Project:
The Employee Salary Management System project is designed to automate the process of
managing employee salaries and related tasks for an organization. The system is designed to
handle various tasks such as adding employee information, calculating salaries, and generating
payroll reports. The system uses a database to store all employee information, including their
personal details, job title, salary information, and tax details.
Project Task
● Draw an ER diagram.
● Normal forms of all tables.
● Key attributes, non-key attributes, Primary key identification,
● Database design has to be done.
● Front-end and back end, finalization along with connectivity.
Functional components of the project:
Following is a list of functionalities of the system. More functionality that you find appropriate
can be added to this list. And, in places where the description of functionality is not adequate,
you can make appropriate assumptions and proceed.
The functional components of the Employee Salary Management System include:
1.⁠ ⁠Employee Information Management: The system should be able to capture and manage the
employee's personal information, job title, salary information, and tax details. This
information should be stored in a database and should be accessible to authorized
personnel.
2.⁠ ⁠Payroll Calculation: The system should be able to calculate employee salaries automatically
based on their job title and the number of hours worked. The system should also handle
deductions such as taxes, insurance, and other benefits.
3.⁠ ⁠Payslip Generation: The system should generate payslips for each employee based on the
calculated salary and deductions. Payslips should be available electronically for employees
to access, and printed copies should be available for distribution.
4.⁠ ⁠Reports Generation: The system should be able to generate various payroll reports, such
as employee-wise payroll summary, tax report, and deduction report. The system should
also allow authorized personnel to generate custom reports as per their requirements.
5.⁠ ⁠Leave Management: The system may include a leave management module that enables
employees to apply for leaves and managers to approve or reject those leave requests.
6.⁠ ⁠Integration with Other Systems: The system should integrate with other systems, such as
accounting software, HR management systems, and attendance management systems, to
ensure seamless data exchange between systems.
7.⁠ ⁠User Roles and Permissions: The system should have different user roles and permissions
to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and modify employee information and
payroll data.
